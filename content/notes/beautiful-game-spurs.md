### The Beautiful Team

When I think about how I build teams,  
I always come back to basketball.

Not the solo-hero, 40-point-game kind.  
But the *beautiful game*.

The San Antonio Spurs.  
2014.  
Peak basketball.  
Five players moving as one.  
No ego, no wasted motion, no hunting for the stat line.

They weren’t just trying to get *a* shot.  
They passed until they got *the best* shot.  
Quick decisions. Unselfish play.  
Everyone in sync.

### Talent Alone Isn’t Enough

We’ve seen what happens when talent doesn’t gel:

- **Jordan before Pippen**  
- **Kobe post-Shaq**  
- **The first Heatles season**

All incredible players.  
All struggling to figure out how to *win together*.

Because the truth is:  
**Talent gets you highlights.  
Chemistry gets you championships.**

### How I Build Teams

That’s exactly how I build and run teams.  
Not just a collection of stars.  
A unit.

Everyone brings their own skillset — their jumper, their court vision, their defensive grit.  
But we work in harmony.

Designers who don’t just polish their own screen,  
but pass to the researcher for insight.  
PMs who move the play forward, not just call the plays.  
Engineers who want to understand the *why*, not just the *what*.

It’s not about credit.  
It’s about flow.  
We move fast, make each other better, and create something that feels inevitable — like it couldn’t have been built any other way.

### Good Isn’t the Goal

We’re not just trying to ship a good feature.  
We’re trying to find the *best* solution — together.

We pass until we find it.  
We shoot when it’s open.  
We celebrate the assist as much as the basket.

That’s what the beautiful game looks like in product.  
That’s what I want to build — every time.
