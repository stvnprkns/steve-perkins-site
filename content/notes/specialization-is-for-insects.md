There's so much pressure to niche down.  
Pick a lane. Become the expert. Stay in it.

But that's never really resonated with me.

The people I admire don't fit clean titles.  
They design and code.  
They write and build.  
They parent and launch startups and learn to weld in their free time.

They aren't optimizing for clarity.  
They're optimizing for *aliveness*.

We're not here to be efficient.  
We're here to make stuff.  
To follow ideas.  
To try things, change directions, and figure it out along the way.

The best work I've done didn't come from doubling down on a narrow skill.  
It came from mixing disciplines.  
From curiosity.  
From doing more than one thing at a time.

You don't have to brand yourself.  
You don't need a niche.  
You just need the guts to be a little messy and keep going.

Explore widely.  
Build loosely.  
Stay human.
