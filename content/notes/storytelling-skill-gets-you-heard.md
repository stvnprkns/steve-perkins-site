> "The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller."

Designers love to talk about craft.  
But the real superpower isn't polish — it's storytelling.

Whether you're explaining a feature, pitching a vision, or trying to get your work approved,  
**you're not just designing — you're telling a story.**

And if people don't feel that story?  
It doesn't matter how good your design is.

### Why It Matters

The best storytellers don't just present work.  
They create momentum.  
They get buy-in.  
They align the team.  
They make the thing feel inevitable — even obvious.

Storytelling turns a "nice mock" into  
> "Wait... why aren't we already doing this?"

### How to Get Better

Here are three reminders I come back to:

#### 1. **No "and then." Only "but" and "therefore."**
From the creators of *South Park*:  
If your story reads like "And then… and then… and then…" it's dead.

Every beat should either raise tension (*but*) or move the story forward (*therefore*).  
That's how you build momentum — not just slides.

#### 2. **Write the beats, not the script.**
The best presenters never memorize their words.  
They memorize the arc.  
You're not reading. You're navigating.  
Know where you're going — and why it matters.

#### 3. **Hook early. Drag late.**
Raise a question early.  
Don't answer it right away.  
Make people *want* the punchline — and then make them wait just a bit.

"It was the worst usability test of my life."  
Now wait.  
Let the room lean in.  
Then show them what happened — and what it taught you.

### Storytelling Isn't Fluff. It's Leverage.

If you're creative and want to lead,  
you need to be the one who shapes the narrative.

Not just the UI.  
Not just the slides.  
The *why*.

That's what moves teams forward.

That's what makes your work real.
