I love this quote. I think about it all the time.  
It’s one of the clearest ways I’ve ever seen someone describe what it actually means to **lead**.

Not manage.  
Not delegate.  
**Lead.**

### What We're Really Doing

When you're building a product — or a team —  
you’re not just assigning tasks.

You’re creating direction.  
A reason.  
A pull toward something bigger than the work itself.

### Design Isn’t Assembly. It’s Emotion.

Design is emotional work.  
It’s judgment. It’s taste. It’s ambiguity.

You can’t optimize that with process alone.  
You have to light something up inside people.

### What Great Teams Share

A great design org doesn’t just have systems.

It has:
- **Longing**  
- **Curiosity**  
- **A shared sense of beauty**  
- **A belief that none of us can do it alone**

That’s the difference.

### The Leader’s Job

Your job isn’t to divvy up the work.

It’s to give the work **meaning**.

Because when people care where they're going,  
they’ll figure out how to get there.

They’ll:
- Stretch  
- Mentor  
- Build better habits  
- Create better UIs  
- And probably ask better questions, too

### Make the Sea Real

The sea — whatever it is for your team —  
has to be **real**.

And it has to be **felt every day**, in:
- The choices you make  
- The feedback you give  
- The way you talk about users  
- The way you talk about quality  
- The way you remind people why any of this matters

### Yes, Do the Work. But...

✅ Build your system  
✅ Create your docs  
✅ Define your expectations

But also —  
**show them the sea.**
