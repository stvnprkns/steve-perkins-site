# Hiring Juniors Builds Your Culture Faster Than Any Offsite Ever Will
Not because they're cheap.  
Not because they're hungry.  
But because they force you to get real about what you believe.

### From Vibes to Principles

It's easy to talk about values in a slide deck.  
Much harder when a junior designer asks,

> "Why do we do it this way?"

Now you need a reason.  
A principle.  
A way of working that can be taught, not just felt.

### Mentorship Makes the Team Better

That process — of slowing down, explaining, mentoring —  
It sharpens the team.  
It turns instincts into systems.  
And it quietly filters out the people who don't actually want to collaborate.

### Juniors Raise the Bar

Great juniors don't just learn fast.  
They make you better at your job.  
Clearer. More intentional. More human.

They also ask questions no one else is brave or new enough to ask:

> "Why do we need this meeting?"  
> "Do users actually want this?"  
> "Can I try something weird?"

but from the quiet ripple of helping someone grow —  
and being changed by it, too.
