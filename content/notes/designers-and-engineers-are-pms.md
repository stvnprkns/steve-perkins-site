Marty Cagan has talked for years about the danger of "feature factories" - PMs who don't own problems, just backlogs. Teams that ship fast, but never ask *why.*

The fix?  
It's not more product managers.  
It's *better* product thinking across the team.

At companies like Linear, there's only one PM.  
Design and engineering lead the rest.  
They own the features.  
They own the outcomes.  
Because they understand the product, the customer, and the stakes.

PM is a function. Not a title.  
The best teams treat product thinking as a shared responsibility.  
Design brings clarity.  
Engineering brings constraints.  
Together, they make the tradeoffs, not just the tickets.

So if you're a designer or engineer waiting on a PM to tell you what to buildâ€”  
you're thinking too small.

Product isn't someone else's job.  
It's yours.
