### Dogfood or Donâ€™t Ship

For consumer products, thereâ€™s no excuse.  
**You *are* the customer.**  
Use the product. Feel the pain. Spot the friction.  
If youâ€™re not dogfooding daily, youâ€™re just guessing.

### For B2B and Enterprise?

Itâ€™s harder.  
You might not be the end user.  
You might not even understand their context.

But that doesnâ€™t mean you get a pass.

You still have to *find a way to feel it*.

- Sit in on real calls  
- Watch them use the product  
- Ask dumb questions  
- Learn their language  
- Feel their constraints  
- Sit next to them â€” literally, if you can

### You Canâ€™t Design What You Donâ€™t Understand

Dogfooding isnâ€™t just about bugs.  
Itâ€™s about empathy.  
Itâ€™s about insight.  
Itâ€™s about knowing, *firsthand*, what itâ€™s like to live inside your product.

If you're building something and have no idea how it feels to use it â€”  
stop building.

Go find out.

Then come back and make it better.
