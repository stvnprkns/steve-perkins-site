### Empathy Isn’t a Moodboard

Designers love to talk about empathy.  
About being the voice of the customer.  
About solving real problems.

But more and more, I see designers who never leave the Figma file.

They tweak. They align. They hover over pixels.  
But they never sit with a customer.  
They never listen to what’s hard.  
They never feel what’s at stake.

### Empathy Isn’t Caring — It’s *Feeling*

Empathy isn’t “being nice.”  
It’s not a brand tone.  
It’s not a UX principle you write in your Notion doc.

**Empathy is when you feel what your customer feels.**  
Confusion. Stress. Shame. Relief. Hope.

It’s when their problem becomes your urgency.  
Not in theory — but in your gut.

### What We Used to Do

At Intuit, we took this seriously.  
We ran offsites where we sat with tax filers as they struggled.  
We ran empathy workshops that felt like group therapy.  
We watched users fail and took it personally — because we built the thing that failed them.

That’s what changed our design.  
That’s what drove breakthrough ideas.  
Not design trends. Not better tooling. Just **better understanding**.

### Get Out of the File

Want to be a better designer?

Close Figma.  
Go listen.  
Go watch.  
Go feel what your customer feels.

Then come back and build something that *matters.*

### The Truth

Empathy is not soft.  
It’s not optional.  
It’s the hardest, most essential part of design.

And it’s what makes you — and the business — better.

So if you haven’t talked to a customer this month,  
don’t tell me you’re empathetic.

Tell me you’re getting there.
