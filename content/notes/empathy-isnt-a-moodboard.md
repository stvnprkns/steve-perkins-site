### Empathy Isn‚Äôt a Moodboard üí≠

Designers love to talk about empathy.  
About being the voice of the customer.  
About solving real problems.

But more and more, I see designers who never leave the Figma file.

They tweak. They align. They hover over pixels.  
But they never sit with a customer.  
They never listen to what‚Äôs hard.  
They never feel what‚Äôs at stake.

### Empathy Isn‚Äôt Caring ‚Äî It‚Äôs *Feeling*

Empathy isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeing nice.‚Äù  
It‚Äôs not a brand tone.  
It‚Äôs not a UX principle you write in your Notion doc.

**Empathy is when you feel what your customer feels.**  
Confusion. Stress. Shame. Relief. Hope.

It‚Äôs when their problem becomes your urgency.  
Not in theory ‚Äî but in your gut.

### What We Used to Do

At Intuit, we took this seriously.  
We ran offsites where we sat with tax filers as they struggled.  
We ran empathy workshops that felt like group therapy.  
We watched users fail and took it personally ‚Äî because we built the thing that failed them.

That‚Äôs what changed our design.  
That‚Äôs what drove breakthrough ideas.  
Not design trends. Not better tooling. Just **better understanding**.

### Get Out of the File

Want to be a better designer?

Close Figma.  
Go listen.  
Go watch.  
Go feel what your customer feels.

Then come back and build something that *matters.*
