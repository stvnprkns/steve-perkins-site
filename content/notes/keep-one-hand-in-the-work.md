### Don't Let Go of the Work

Some people say that once you become a manager or a director,  
you should "stay out of the weeds."

I get it.  
You've got people to coach. Strategy to own. Meetings to survive.

But here's what I've learned:  
**You should still make things.**

Not everything. Not all the time.  
But enough to stay close to the craft.

### Why It Matters

Leading without doing is dangerous.  
You lose:
- **Context**  
- **Credibility**  
- **Curiosity**  

You start to manage from abstraction ‚Äî  
metrics, decks, rituals ‚Äî instead of from the *actual shape* of the work.

You give feedback that sounds good but doesn't help.  
You start to confuse *taste* with *process.*  
And slowly, the team notices.

### What IC Work Looks Like at Higher Levels

You don't need to be the one pushing every pixel.  
But you can still:
- Prototype early ideas  
- Jam on weird side explorations  
- Write out a product narrative  
- Run a scrappy research sprint  
- Redesign one thing that's been broken for months  
- Pair with a junior to sharpen their thinking (and yours)

This isn't about control.  
It's about connection.

### Leading With Your Hands, Not Just Your Calendar

When you make time to build ‚Äî even just a little ‚Äî  
you:
- Stay sharp  
- Earn trust  
- Get out of meetings with better questions  
- Feel the product again

And that?  
That makes you a better leader.  
Not a distracted one.  
A present one.

It doesn't mean doing your team's job.  
It means remembering what the job really is.

Stay close. Stay useful. Stay alive.

**You don't outgrow the work.**  
You just learn new ways to show up inside it.
