## What a Founding Designer Really Does  

It’s common to see startups hire junior or mid-level designers into founding roles.  
Sometimes it’s about speed. Sometimes it’s about budget.  
And sometimes it works—for a while.

But if you want design to *drive* your business, not just support it,  
you need more than someone who can execute.  
You need someone who can *think.*

A true founding designer is more than just a set of hands in Figma.  
They’re a strategic partner.

They ask hard questions.  
They connect product to user needs *and* business outcomes.  
They shape the roadmap, the brand, the user experience—and often, the culture.

They’re in the weeds building, yes.  
But they’re also upstream, making decisions that move the needle.

### This role isn’t just about components, or polish, or shipping quickly.  
It’s about clarity.  
Focus.  
Conviction.

A great founding designer works like a co-founder:  
- Driving vision  
- Synthesizing research  
- Prioritizing the right bets  
- Making the intangible feel inevitable

If you’re a startup, invest in that.  
If you’re a designer, grow toward that.

It’s not about seniority for its own sake.  
It’s about impact.

Design has the potential to shape the entire arc of a company—  
but only if you give it a seat at the table from day one.
