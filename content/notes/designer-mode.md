Design isn't about pixels.  
It's about focus.

The best designers I've worked with don't just polishâ€”they *push*.  
They live in the problem.  
They kill features, not just tweak them.  
They ask hard questions before opening Figma.

> Why are we building this?  
> Who's it for?  
> What happens if we don't?

Designer Mode means thinking like a product ownerâ€”  
seeing the business, the user, the system, and the tradeoffs.

It's not decorative.  
It's directional.

When you're in it, everything has intent.  
If it's not solving the right problem, it doesn't belong.  
If it's not helping the business, it's noise.  
If it's just "pretty," it's probably in the way.

Design is leadership.  
Quiet, invisible, but deeply felt.

When it's working, no one notices.  
They just say:  
> "Yeah, this feels right."

That's Designer Mode.
