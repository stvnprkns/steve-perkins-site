### How I Think About Planning in a Fast-Moving Environment  
Steve Perkins 🧫 · Oct 19, 2024

Roadmaps are supposed to create clarity.  
But too often, they become rigid artifacts we follow out of obligation.

They give us something to point to in meetings.  
Something to reassure leadership.  
Something to say:  
> "This is the plan."

But the longer I've been doing this, the more I've realized:  
**That level of certainty is usually a false signal.**

### The Comfort of a Fixed Plan

John Cutler once posed a question I think about a lot:

> What if you deleted your roadmap entirely?  
> What if you stopped shipping new features?  
> Would your users even notice?

It's uncomfortable — and that's the point.  
If the answer is "not really," then maybe the roadmap isn't creating much value.

### The Problem With Long-Term Planning

A year-long roadmap asks you to commit to a future you haven't earned.  
You lock in features, timelines, and bets before you've validated the problem.  
Then the market shifts. Priorities evolve. New context appears.

And yet we stick to the plan — because we said we would.

This doesn't create alignment.  
It creates inertia.

### Focus on Outcomes, Not Feature Lists

What's helped me is reframing the roadmap:  
**Less output, more outcome.**

- What's the user problem?  
- What's the business objective?  
- What evidence do we need to know we're on the right track?

It's not about removing direction.  
It's about leaving space to learn.

Roadmaps should be flexible.  
They should breathe.

### What I Recommend

Here's what's worked well on teams I've led or advised:

- **Plan quarterly.** 12 months is fiction.  
- **Anchor to outcomes.** Not just tickets or features.  
- **Revisit often.** Treat the roadmap like a hypothesis, not a promise.  
- **Let go of sunk cost.** If a feature no longer makes sense, cut it.

And when someone asks for your annual roadmap,  
there's nothing wrong with saying:

> "We have strong hypotheses for the next quarter,  
> and structured ways to evaluate what comes after."

That's not indecision.  
That's how you stay relevant.
