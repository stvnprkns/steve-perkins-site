Product-led growth isn't just a go-to-market strategy.  
It's a design mindset.

You're not designing for a demo.  
You're designing for discovery.

Here's what that means:

**✴️ Create value immediately**  
Your goal is the first "aha."  
Every screen should reduce friction and *show* value, not ask for patience.

**⚛️ Design for self-serve**  
No one wants onboarding.  
They want progress.  
The product should teach itself—via clarity, context, and momentum.

**❇️ Create micro-moments**  
Users remember how it *felt*.  
Delight lives in the details: small surprises, confident flows, and feedback that earns trust.

**🔁 Design for retention**  
Growth isn't just top-of-funnel.  
Design the parts that make people *stay*.  
Solve real problems. Get them hooked on outcomes.

Good PLG design doesn't just convert.  
It compounds.
