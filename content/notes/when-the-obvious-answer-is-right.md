### The Obvious Answer Isn't Always the Easy Way Out

Sometimes you land on an answer too quickly, and it feels wrong just because it came too easy.

You think: it can't be this simple.
So you keep going. You explore other paths. You try to earn it.

As a designer, that's a habit I've built over time â€” to keep working the problem, to push for something smarter, more original. Something that proves I thought about it.

But here's the thing: the obvious answer isn't always low-hanging fruit. Low-hanging fruit is the shortcut. The quick win you take because you're tired or under pressure. It's the "just ship it" version.

The obvious answer is different. It's the thing that works because it makes sense. Because it matches what people expect. Because it's clear. You don't have to explain it. You don't have to teach around it. It just works.

Knowing the difference takes practice. And being okay with choosing the obvious answer takes some ego management. Because you're not impressing anyone. You're just solving the problem.

That's the job.

The longer I do this, the more I realize: my value isn't in how many paths I explore. It's in how fast I can see which one actually works.
