Not all companies are bad.  
But not all good companies leave a mark, either.

Here's how I think about it now:

- **Bad companies** teach you what not to do.  
- **Good companies** do enough right, and not enough wrong—but the takeaways are minimal.  
- **Great companies** change you. They shape how you work, what you value, and what you carry with you.

**Intuit** was a great company.

It was creative, empowered, experimental.  
We did follow-me-homes.  
We sat with customers.  
We explored before we executed.  
And we had the top-down support to actually follow through on good ideas.

But a lot of what made it great depended on structure—on deep org alignment, exec support, and a culture built for listening.  
I've been trying to recreate that foundation ever since.

**Argo** was great in a different way.

I was only there for two months.  
But the rituals stuck.

- Design Rodeo  
- Communal lunch tables  
- Standups that were filled with jokes and games  
- Craft that was expected, not performative  
- Fun *and* pressure. Talent *and* humanity.

Even in a short time, I left with things I wanted to bring everywhere.  
That's what great companies do—they leave a trace in how you work.

**Good companies** don't.

They feel functional.  
The work gets done.  
The structure mostly holds.  
But the culture doesn't imprint.  
The lessons don't last.  
You're not better or worse—you're just *through.*

I think about this a lot when I lead teams, or help companies level up design:  
Are we creating something that's just effective?  
Or something people will try to rebuild when they leave?

Great companies become reference points.  
Everything after is either trying to reach that bar—or avoid falling below it.
