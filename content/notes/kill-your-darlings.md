You'll have ideas you love.  
Flows you're proud of.  
Screens that feel *just right.*

Kill them anyway.

> "You must kill all your darlings."  
> — William Faulkner

In design, attachment is dangerous.  
It clouds your judgment.  
It turns critique into defense.  
It makes progress feel like loss.

But here's the truth:  
**Nobody cares how long it took.**  
They care if it's better.

If that clever moment, that perfect motion, that extra layer of nuance isn't making the product simpler, faster, more valuable—  
It's baggage.

Don't polish it.  
Cut it.

Good design isn't polite.  
It's decisive.

Designer Mode means cutting the things you love when they aren't the things that serve.

Ruthless? Yes.  
But that's how you make room for something better.
