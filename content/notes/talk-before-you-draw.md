Great products don't start in Figma.  
They start in conversation.

Before the mockups, before the roadmap,  
just talk to people.

Not after you've got something polished.  
Not when it's too late to hear real feedback.

Early.  
Messy.  
Raw.

Share a half-baked idea.  
Sketch something on paper.  
Ask them to imagine it with you.

> "What would you change?"  
> "What feels off?"  
> "What's missing?"

This is where the real insight lives.

The kind you don't get from user testing.  
The kind that shapes the direction, not just tweaks the UI.

Talk early.  
Build late.  
Confidence comes from knowing *why* you're building â€” not just *how* it looks.
