Shipping builds confidence. Waiting builds pressure. Even a half-good release builds more momentum than a perfectly scoped delay.

## Why Momentum Matters

- **Rapid Feedback**: Get real user input faster
- **Team Morale**: Small wins keep the team motivated
- **Iterative Improvement**: Each release informs the next

> "Perfect is the enemy of good." â€” Voltaire

## How to Maintain Momentum

1. Set clear, incremental goals
2. Embrace the "good enough" mindset
3. Learn from each iteration

```javascript
// Example: Shipping an MVP
function shipMVP(features) {
  const mvp = features.filter(feature => isEssential(feature));
  return deploy(mvp);
}
```

Remember: Done is better than perfect!
